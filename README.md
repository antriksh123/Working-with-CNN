# Working-with-CNN

## Identify Cat or Dog using CNN
In this project, we leverage the power of CNNs to build an image classifier capable of identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The dataset consists of an extensive collection of labeled images of cats and dogs, which are used to train and evaluate the CNN model.

The project folder includes the Jupyter Notebook and datasets.
